## Testing 

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to [FunTime-Quiz]( https://ujuadimora-dev.github.io/FunTime-Quiz/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected with the exception of switching to landscape . 

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- Oukitel C21 Pro
- TCL 30 Pro
- iPhone SE
- Samsung Galaxy Tablet

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

Issue : After keyboard controls were implemented, while testing the site with windows 'Narrator' screenreader, it was not clearly known what the purpose of the labels/checkboxes were. An aria-label label was added to the labels for screen readers to alert them that the labels were clickable and what their purpose was. Note:  I was only able to perform thise text of th e time factor.
